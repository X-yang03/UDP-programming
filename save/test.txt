As software-as-a-service and Cloud computing become
increasingly popular, server and Cloud applications exhibit
notoriously large instruction sets that do not fit in the first
level instruction cache (L1I), leading to high L1I miss rates
and therefore stalls. This causes significant performance degradation, in addition to wasteful energy expenditure and underutilization of resources.
Until now, processors have been traditionally designed for
scientific and desktop applications, with very different characteristics, making them inefficient for the large and everincreasing instruction footprint of server applications. According to a study conducted by Google [25] over three years on
one of their Warehouse Scale Computing (WSC) live centers
with tens of thousands of server machines running workloads
and services used by billions of users, processors do useful
work for only 10-20% of the time, stalling for more than 80%
of the time. This analysis demonstrates that one of the main
reasons of stalling is that instructions are not available for
